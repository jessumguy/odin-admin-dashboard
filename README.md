**04/06/2023 Reflection:**

I quite enjoyed this project to the point that I'd say it was theraputic in nature. No real frustration to note of.

Used a combination of both Grid and Flexbox to layout the page. 

The css file does feel large and messy. A preprocessor may help in this regard.

**Weaknesses:**

1. Font Size feel too big at normal resolution - May need to play around with the font weights.

2. Background colours don't feel right - I resorted to random colours.

3. Avatar and Icons not colourful - Wasn't able to find free svg for the avatars, settling for the free ones from `pictogrammers.com`, and applying a circle border around them.

2. Text under the Project and Announcement cards - Wasn't able to get the description text to feel right, and so settled for a stackoverflow solution using `-webkit-line-clamp: 3` and  `text-overflow: ellipsis;`.
